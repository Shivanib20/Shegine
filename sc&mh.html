        <button type="button" onclick="alert('1. Good Absorbency One of the most important elements of a good sanitary pad is the ability to absorb a large volume of blood in a short span of time. Blood absorbed should also be locked into the centre core, eliminating the chance of backflow when pressure is applied to the pad (for example when sitting down).2. Length and Flow Blood discharge is usually heavier at the start of your period, so it is essential to choose a pad that can quickly and effectively absorb your flow.Sanitary pads are classified as Day or Night, with Day pads being shorter (ranging from 17cm to 25cm) and Night pads going all the way to 35cm or more. The longer the pad, the more fluids it can absorb.3. Material Comfort  Sanitary pads are either made of cotton or plastic netted. Everyoneâ€™s skin is different, thus the comfort levels with certain materials differ as well. Some girls prefer a soft touch whilst others may prefer a netted top layer. The type of material also affects its breathability.')">Choose Right Sanitary Pad</button><br>
